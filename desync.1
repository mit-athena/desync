.SH NAME
desync \- desynchronize timed jobs on networks
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B desync
[
.B \-t
timefile ] [ range ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I desync
is a tool which sleeps a random (hostname seeded) period of time (up
to an hour, by default) in order to skew the network load from several
machines running
.I cron
jobs that would otherwise be synchronized.

An invocation would appear something like

.nf
     42 * * * *          desync; /usr/lib/sendmail -q
.fi

in a crontab file.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 8
.B range
This optional range specifies, in seconds, the maximum value for the
randomly selected sleep time.  The default value is 3600.
.TP 8
.B \-h name
Use
.I name
to seed the random number generator, instead of using the current host
name.  This option is generally only useful in conjunction with the
.B \-n
option.
.TP 8
.B \-n
Instead of sleeping, this option causes
.I desync
to write the number of seconds it would sleep to standard output, or,
if the
.B \-t
option is also specified, the number of seconds remaining until the
timer in
.I timefile
expires.
.TP 8
.B \-t timefile
This option changes the behavior of
.I desync
to make it useful for desynchronizing jobs when sleeping is not
appropriate.  If
.I timefile
does not exist,
.I desync
selects a random sleep time using the normal method, adds it to the
current time value, writes the result into
.IR timefile ,
and exits with status 1.  If
.I timefile
does exist and the current time is less than the time value listed in
.IR timefile ,
then
.I desync
takes no action and exits with status 1.  If
.I timefile
exists and the current time is equal to or greater than the time value
listed in
.IR timefile ,
then
.I desync
unlinks
.I timefile
and exits with status 0.  This feature can be used in shell code of
the following form:

.nf
	if desync -t /tmp/mytimefile 3600; then
		echo "Starting the job."
	else
		echo "Putting it off until later."
	fi
.fi
